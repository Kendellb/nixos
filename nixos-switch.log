evaluation warning: xdg-desktop-portal 1.17 reworked how portal implementations are loaded, you
                    should either set `xdg.portal.config` or `xdg.portal.configPackages`
                    to specify which portal backend to use for the requested interface.

                    If you simply want to keep the behaviour in < 1.17, which uses the first
                    portal implementation found in lexicographical order, use the following:

                    xdg.portal.config.common.default = "*";
